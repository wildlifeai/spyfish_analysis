# Spyfish Aotearoa - Analyis
This repository contains the scripts and information required to analyse annotations by citizen scientists, biologists and AI of Baited Underwater Videos from New Zealand. 
The output of the video analysis is the maximum number of individuals of a given species present in a 30-min Baited Underwater Video (MaxN). MaxN is a metric of fish abundance often used in the [monitoring of demersal fish](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13470).
